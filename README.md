#MovingZeroToTheEnd.js: 
    - Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

#textStrips.js: 
    - Complete the solution so that it strips all text that follows any of a set of comment markers passed in. Any whitespace at the end of the line should also be stripped out.

#MeanSquare.js: 
    - Complete the function that
    - accepts two integer arrays of equal length. compares the value each member in one array to the  corresponding member in the other. squares the absolute value difference between those two values and returns the average of those squared absolute value difference between each member pair.

#MatrixDeterminant.js: 
    - Write a function that accepts a square matrix (N x N 2D array) and returns the determinant of the matrix.

#ValidParentheses.js:
    - Write a function that takes a string of parentheses, and determines if the order of the parentheses is valid. The function should return true if the string is valid, and false if it's invalid.

#pigLatin.js: 
    - Move the first letter of each word to the end of it, then add "ay" to the end of the word. Leave punctuation marks untouched.

#stringToInteger.js: 
    - In this kata we want to convert a string into an integer. The strings simply  represent the numbers in words.

    - Examples:

        "one" => 1
        "twenty" => 20
        "two hundred forty-six" => 246
        "seven hundred eighty-three thousand nine hundred and nineteen" => 783919
        Additional Notes:

        The minimum number is "zero" (inclusively)
        The maximum number, which must be supported is 1 million (inclusively)
        The "and" in e.g. "one hundred and twenty-four" is optional, in some cases it's present and in others it's not
        All tested numbers are valid, you don't need to validate them

#closeMultiple10.js : 
    - Return the closest number multiple of 10
